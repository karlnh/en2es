Translate a sentence from English into Spanish and click the words to get a dictionary definition of that word in Spanish.

Spanish is the second most popular second language to learn in the United States besides English. When studying any language it is important to understand the different implications of any given word in a sentence. This tool is meant for beginner Spanish learners looking to translate an English sentence into Spanish and understanding the components of the translation. 

## Usage

![Screenshot of deployed application.](https://github.com/karlnh/en2es/blob/3175d3d0a154349cbfa4813700e093195f013a43/assets/img/screenshot.png)

The website functions like most translation apps. The user enters text and clicks translate to get the Spanish version of the sentence.
The user can then click on individual words to get a definition, if available.
The clicked word is saved to local storage and displayed upon page refresh.

## Problems

As of now the project relies on the Merriam-Webster English-Spanish Dictionary API. This API is difficult to use and does not always include important information; it is confused by conjugations and declensions and does not give alternative forms for words. It is probable that a better API is needed.
